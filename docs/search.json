This module is like a refreshment and updated version of knowledge and technology that I learned in the past.\nThe advancement of the resolutions blows my mind. I used to work on Landsat 7’ image with 15-60m resolution, 7+1 bands, and 16 days temporal resolution. Mostly I used satellite images at my work in coal mining company for topographic map and DEM(Digital Elevation Model) to calculate the overburden removal and coal extraction volume.\nWith the newest technology, the improvement of remote sensing satellite such as Sentinel with better resolutions and Google Earth Engine makes different and broaden the type of analysis that we can do such as object-based image detection with better and faster result.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, D.

Quarto makes it even more convenient because it is integrated to several platforms such as RStudio and VSCode (I use both of these). Xaringan is on another level, it can generate Rmarkdown into slides!

Quick facts about Jakarta:\n\nPopulation:\nArea:\nWater catchment area:\nGeographical situation:\nRisk:\n\nReference: Estimation, modeling, and prediction of land subsidence using Sentinel-1 time series in Tehran-Shahriar plain: A machine learning-based investigation\nRelated issues\n\nClean water\n\nRelated global initiative\nSDGs\n\n\n4.1.2 Data\n\nInSAR Sentinel-1\nIn this study, a total number of 193 Sentinel-1A images acquired between October 8, 2014 and March 28, 2019 were used.\nAdditionally, we used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for preliminary geocoding and removing the topographic phase component.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Methods\n\nIn the former category, water flow and soil mechanics have been modeled through simulating the process of LS in aquifer systems according to groundwater abstraction and geological, geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions (Fernandez et al., 2018; Bajni et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020). In such methods, it is necessary to access accurate hydrogeological data and adopt various assumptions (Ilia et al., 2018).\nSeveral studies have applied Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) techniques and statistical-empirical methods such as back propagation neural networks (BPNs) (Dehghani et al., 2013), long short-term memory (LSTM) (Li et al., 2020), geographically weighted LSTM (GW-LSTM) (Li et al., 2021), Random forest (RF) (Ilia et al., 2018), analytical hierarchy process coupled with sensitivity analysis (AHP-SA) (Zhu et al., 2013), and GIS based spatial analysis (Zhu et al., 2015) to model and predict LS.\nThe geological and hydrological parameters considered for LS modeling using the ML methods include groundwater level change, aquifer media, precipitation rate, slope, land use, depth to water table, distance from exploiting wells, distance from rivers, and distance from faults.\nAll these layers were converted to raster, and their values were extracted to PS points detected by PS-InSAR analysis as sample points. The effects of these parameters on LS were investigated and the most important parameters were determined.\nIn this paper, we applied the PS-InSAR technique proposed by Ferretti et al. (2001) to monitor LS at millimeter precision (Perissin, 2016) over the study period. This technique is based on detection of points (or targets) called the permanent scatterers (PS) that remain unchanged over the entire period. For PS-InSAR analysis, single look complex (SLC) images of the same area were co-registered to a single master configuration preferably selected from the middle of the spatial and temporal baseline spaces (Hanssen, 2001). Interferograms were then generated from multi-temporal SAR images. Finally, the orbital data and the external SRTM DEM were used to remove the Earth curvature influence and the topographic component of the interferometric phase, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, this study combine: PS-InSAR (mm precision), ANN, and RF to model the\n\n\n4.1.4 Solutions\nCurrent policy\nMari Simak Peraturan Larangan Penggunaan Air Tanah di DKI Jakarta\nGroundwater, key to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nSDGs goal 6: Clean water and sanitation\n\nIndonesian government set the restriction of groundwater extraction by different fees, will it work?\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Limitations and Future\n\nTo validate the estimated LS measurements, it is necessary that the vertical displacement is compared with the GPS measurements.\nAccuracy\nFuture: NISAR (NASA-ISRO SAR EO satellite launch in 2024) with 2 bands (L-band and S-band)"
