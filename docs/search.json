The sunlight is hitting the earth and the earth reflects the light and satellites capture it.\nElectromagnetic energy has waves, have wavelength\n![Electromagnetic Waves](img/fig1.png){width=“60%”}\nSource: [Google Earth Engine 101](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cdfc91d050634a5294ac897acc959d55) Stanford Geospatial Centre\n> Spectral sampling\nRGB, Red Green Blue Spectrum\nreflect vs absorb\nin each spectral/spectrum, the image will be white if it reflects the spactrum\n255 spectrum of each RGB\n> Observing the surface of the earth\nSatellites can see OUTSIDE RGB (more than 3 spectrum/band), such as infrared, panchromatic (black n white, take the intensity value), shortwave infrared, thermal infrared, etc.\n> Classifying the pixels through the wavelength"
