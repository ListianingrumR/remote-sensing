### RBV vs MSS {.unnumbered}

RBV: Return Beam Vidicon (TV-like cameras) >> system was analog
MSS: Multi-Spectral Scanner![](img/Screen Shot 2023-01-24 at 13.22.33.png)

### Push broom vs Whisk broom {.unnumbered}

Push broom: spotlight/across track scanners
Whisk broom: along track scanners

## Corrections {.unnumbered}
- scan lines

### Geometric correction (parallax! remember photogrammetry) {.unnumbered}
- view angle
- topography
- wind
- rotation of the earth

Geometric correction on satellite vs airplane?

How to deal with?
GCP: Ground Control Point
linear regression: parallax
- RMSE >> adding more GCPs can 
- Resample methods if the grid cells not align!:
	- Nearest neighbor
	- linear
	- cubic
	- cubic spline

### Atmospheric correction {.unnumbered}
Not necessary if you only have one single image or not a time-series tiles
Necessary: have time elements (want to see the same spot in various times/time-series)

Atmosphere will absorb/scatter the sunlight and create haze!
Now there are: surface reflectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD)

> ! bright object/really reflective object can cause to *adjacency effect* (one pixel influence others)

How to deal with?
- Absolute (basically it is making a model of atmosphere)
	- FLAASH
	- Py6S (Python Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum)
	- need a lot of data/atmosphere element from station (e.g. )
- Relative:
	- DOS (Dark Object Subtraction)
	- PIFs (Psuedo-Invariant Features)
		determine feature that don't change, make regression model per band:

Empirical line correction
- using field spectometer

Irradiance vs radiance

### Orthorectification correction / topographic correction {.unnumbered}
- cosine correction
- mineart correction
- statistical empirical correction
- c correction (advancing the cosine)

**cosine correctional **

### Radiometric calibration {.unnumbered}
Sensors capture image brightness and are distributed as a Digital Number (or DN) - allows for efficient storage but **has no units!**

DN to **spectral radiance** = radiometric calibration
Radiometric calibration: Correct DN to spectral radiance

## Data joining and enhancement {.unnumbered}

### Mosaicking {.unnumbered}

### Image enhancement {.unnumbered}
- image stretch
- ratio
- fusion: multi-temporal images or images from different satellites
	pan sharpening (use grey band/panchromatic to sharpen the rgb band)
- GEOBIA (Object-Based Image Analysis) [](https://gisgeography.com/obia-object-based-image-analysis-geobia/)

## Summary {.unnumbered}

### Part 1: corrections {.unnumbered}

-   Imagery may contain error from a variety of sources
-   We must correct where appropriate 
-   We must contextualise the use of the imagery 

### Part 2: data joining and enhancement {.unnumbered}

-   Mosaicing in with a standard method isn't appropriate for satellite imagery 
-   Imagery can be "improved/enhanced" based on the energy reflected and the contrast between features 
-   But...
    -   How do these methods help **in urban environments**
    -   Does adding complexity to imagery (or creating new datasets) **assist us** in our aim?

### Task {.unnumbered}
MAKE AN RS DICTIONARY (zenith, azimuth)

Level means specific product (temp, humidity, etc)
