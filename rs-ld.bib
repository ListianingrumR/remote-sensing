  abstract = {Land subsidence (LS) is a major geologic hazard threatening most areas in Iran due to excessive groundwater extractions. The main objective of this study was to estimate LS applying PS-InSAR technique and then model and predict it through machine learning methods. Sentinel-1 time series images were used to retrieve LS from 2014 to 2019. Random forest regression (RFR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were implemented to model LS of 2014–2017 using some conditioning factors including groundwater level decline, aquifer media, precipitation rate, slope, landuse type, depth to water table, distance from exploiting wells, distance from rivers and distance from faults as independent variables. The best calibrated method was used to predict LS over 2018–2019. In addition, all k-combinations (k=1: n, n is the number of factors) of conditioning factors were evaluated to identify the best combination resulting in the best output. The procedure was examined in the Southwest of Tehran and Shahriar plain, Iran. The maximum cumulative displacement values were 561.78 and 638.5~mm for Tehran and Shahriar, respectively. The accuracy assessment showed the RMSE value of 9.97~mm for LS retrieval. The experimental results of LS modeling indicated that RFR outperformed ANN, representing more robust and reliable results with the RMSE value of 1.35~mm for the both study areas. The investigation of the possible factor combinations showed that using the 4-factor combination consisting of precipitation, ground water table change and depth to water table along with distance from faults for S1 and the thickness of fine-grained soil layers (clay and silt) for S2 have presented promising results in modeling and predicting LS. Using all the conditioning factors, LS was predicted with RMSE value of 2.53~mm and 2.09~mm for S1 and S2, respectively. Using the 4-factor combination, however, the prediction RMSE increased by 0.13~mm and 0.04~mm for S1 and S2, respectively. This 5-percent difference can be ignored against decreasing the total cost of applying all factors. This study demonstrates the usability of processing Sentinel-1 data for LS retrieval and applying RFR for LS prediction.},

  abstract = {The technological developments in remote sensing (RS) during the past decade has contributed to a significant increase in the size of data user community. For this reason data quality issues in remote sensing face a significant increase in importance, particularly in the era of Big Earth data. Dozens of available sensors, hundreds of sophisticated data processing techniques, countless software tools assist the processing of RS data and contributes to a major increase in applications and users. In the past decades, scientific and technological community of spatial data environment were focusing on the evaluation of data quality elements computed for point, line, area geometry of vector and raster data. Stakeholders of data production commonly use standardised parameters to characterise the quality of their datasets. Yet their efforts to estimate the quality did not reach the general end-user community running heterogeneous applications who assume that their spatial data is error-free and best fitted to the specification standards. The non-specialist, general user group has very limited knowledge how spatial data meets their needs. These parameters forming the external quality dimensions implies that the same data system can be of different quality to different users. The large collection of the observed information is uncertain in a level that can decry the reliability of the applications.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of ‘grey’ literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {In colour remote sensing of water, the effect of geometric correction on the extraction of water reflectance is worth exploring. The spectral data were measured by sampling three polluted water bodies in Zhengzhou City, and the Planet satellite image data of these areas were obtained and divided into two groups (with and without geometric correction). The two groups of images were then subjected to atmospheric correction using the quick atmospheric correction (QUAC) algorithm to obtain the remote-sensing reflectance values of the water bodies. The results showed that, for the two different extraction methods, the original data and geometrically corrected extraction results are approximately equal, and the spectral curves show similar trends. Compared with the measured spectral data, it is found that the two groups of data extracted from remote sensing images are more likely to show large-scale changes between the red band and the near-infrared (NIR) band. It is concluded that geometric correction affects values of water reflectance based on extraction of images, but has less effect on the overall trend of the curve, and the probability of changes of water reflectance extraction in NIR band is higher than in other bands.}

  abstract = {Remote sensing is mainly used to investigate sites of dams, bridges, and pipelines to locate construction materials and provide detailed geographic information. In remote sensing image analysis, the images captured through satellite and drones are used to observe surface of the Earth. The main aim of any image classification-based system is to assign semantic labels to captured images, and consequently, using these labels, images can be arranged in a semantic order. The semantic arrangement of images is used in various domains of digital image processing and computer vision such as remote sensing, image retrieval, object recognition, image annotation, scene analysis, content-based image analysis, and video analysis. The earlier approaches for remote sensing image analysis are based on low-level and mid-level feature extraction and representation. These techniques have shown good performance by using different feature combinations and machine learning approaches. These earlier approaches have used small-scale image dataset. The recent trends for remote sensing image analysis are shifted to the use of deep learning model. Various hybrid approaches of deep learning have shown much better results than the use of a single deep learning model. In this review article, a detailed overview of the past trends is presented, based on low-level and mid-level feature representation using traditional machine learning concepts. A summary of publicly available image benchmarks for remote sensing image analysis is also presented. A detailed summary is presented at the end of each section. An overview regarding the current trends of deep learning models is presented along with a detailed comparison of various hybrid approaches based on recent trends. The performance evaluation metrics are also discussed. This review article provides a detailed knowledge related to the existing trends in remote sensing image classification and possible future research directions.},
