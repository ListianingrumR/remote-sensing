# Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Summary

### What is Remote Sensing?

Remote sensing data is digital images and digital images are made of pixels, and pixels are representations of numeric values.

Those values represent the amount of reflected electromagnetic energy (which is everywhere, and everything reflects or absorbs it differently, and measurably). The sunlight is hitting the earth and the earth reflects the light and satellites capture it.

Electromagnetic energy has waves, have wavelength

**Spectral sampling**

RGB, Red Green Blue Spectrum

reflect vs absorb

in each spectral/spectrum, the image will be white if it reflects the spactrum

255 spectrum of each RGB

**Observing the surface of the earth**

Satellites can see OUTSIDE RGB (more than 3 spectrum/band), such as infrared, panchromatic (black n white, take the intensity value), shortwave infrared, thermal infrared, etc [@knuth84].

**Classifying the pixels through the wavelength**
